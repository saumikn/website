In this post, I will discuss the implementation of closed-form Conditional Probability Regression Splines (CPRS) in Python. This method is useful for modeling complex relationships in data.

## Introduction

Closed-form CPRS provides a way to estimate conditional probabilities using regression splines. This technique is particularly effective in scenarios where the relationship between variables is non-linear.

## Implementation

To implement closed-form CPRS in Python, we can use libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. Below is a simple example of how to set up the model:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline

# Sample data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2.5, 3.5, 5.0, 7.0, 11.0])

# Fit a spline to the data
spline = UnivariateSpline(x, y, s=0)

# Predict values
x_new = np.linspace(1, 5, 100)
y_new = spline(x_new)
```

In this example, we first import the necessary libraries and create sample data. We then fit a spline to the data and use it to predict new values.

## Visualization

To visualize the results, we can use Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(x, y, label='Data Points')
plt.plot(x_new, y_new, label='Fitted Spline', color='red')
plt.title('Closed-Form CPRS Visualization')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code will generate a plot showing the original data points and the fitted spline, allowing us to see how well the model captures the underlying relationship.

## Conclusion

The closed-form CPRS method is a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in data. By leveraging Python's libraries, we can easily implement and visualize this technique.
