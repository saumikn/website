In this post, I will discuss some functions I created to compress a chess board state into a set of integers, based on the component functions created during the [Stockfish evaluation process](https://hxim.github.io/Stockfish-Evaluation-Guide/).

## Introduction

Last week, I went over some functions I created to compress a chess board state into a set of integers, based on the component functions created during the Stockfish evaluation process.

## Visual Representation

## Functionality

The functions I developed aim to analyze chess positions and determine biases in player behavior. This involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various chess games.
2. **Analysis**: Using statistical methods to identify patterns in player moves.
3. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data to better understand biases.

## Conclusion

This exploration into chess player biases is just the beginning. By analyzing player behavior, we can gain insights into how different strategies are employed and how biases may affect game outcomes.

Stay tuned for more updates on this research!
