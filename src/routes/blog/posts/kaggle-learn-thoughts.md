In this post, I will share my thoughts on Kaggle Learn, a platform where experienced data scientists teach practical data skills.

## Introduction

After graduating, I was looking for online resources for studying data science, and I stumbled upon [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn). Kaggle Learn is a platform where experienced data scientists teach practical data skills, and allow you to immediately use these skills in Kaggle's version of Jupyter Notebooks, called Kaggle Kernels.

## Courses Offered

The list of courses offered on Kaggle is constantly evolving, with a new course coming every few months. Currently, the offered courses are:

- Python
- Intro to Machine Learning
- Data Visualization: from Non-Coder to Coder
- Intermediate Machine Learning
- Pandas
- Deep Learning
- Data Visualization

While most of these courses are structured in a very simple manner, I think that the one topic they fail is the Deep Learning micro-course. Instead of teaching simple overviews of concepts, they go a little deeper and present short videos (3-10 minutes) on each concept like Convolutions, Transfer Learning, and Gradient Descent. I already had a good knowledge of all these coming into the course, so I didn't really learn much from this micro-course anyway. However, I also don't think that the Kaggle Learn platform is suited for these more complicated topics, and your time would be better spent on a different website instead.

## Conclusion

Instead of trying to explain these more complicated concepts, it would be better to keep covering simple topics that can be explained with just short text and code examples. Maybe you can still explain the topics a little, and show how to implement them in Python, but the videos are too much, I think. Of course, I don't think going deeper into the content can hurt, but it goes against the core idea of the platform which is to immediately get going with the content.
