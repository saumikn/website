It has been a very fun six weeks in the [States Chess Cup](https://new.uschess.org/news/2020-states-cup-underway). We've had a lot of great chess being played, with no shortage of upsets and nerve-wracking finishes! Here's a quick update on the playoff picture.

As a reminder, the top two teams from each division qualify for a single-elimination playoff bracket. The top two third-place teams from the East, Central, or West, will also qualify for playoffs as a wild-card, to compensate for their larger division sizes compared to the other divisions.

In the East, the standings are pretty clear. #1 Michigan, at 5/6, will clinch the 1st seed in the division with either a win or a draw against #4 Pennsylvania. With a close loss, Michigan would drop down to a wild-card spot, but a decisive win by Pennsylvania could see them overtake Michigan.

In the South, #1 Virginia is in clear first with 4/5, and will clinch the 1st seed with either a win or draw against #3 Florida. Thanks to their great tiebreaks, a loss would still keep them in the playoffs, if they can keep it close against Florida. #2 Georgia, with 3/5, will clinch playoffs with a win against #5 Alabama.

In the Central, the playoffs have essentially already begun! #1 Minnesota and #2 Iowa, both with 5/6, are playing a match with everything on the line - the winner takes 1st seed in the division, while the loser is eliminated! #3 Missouri and #4 Illinois, both with 4/6, are playing an equally important match. The loser is eliminated from the league, while the winner most likely advances to the playoffs, overtaking the loser of MN-IA on tiebreaks.

In the West, arguably the strongest division, there are still 5 teams remaining with a chance at the playoffs. #1 California-N has a full-point bye this week, so they will end up with 5.5/7, clinching the top seed in the playoffs. #2 Washington, at 4.5/6 could join them in the playoffs with a win against #7 Hawaii. #3 California-S, #4 Arizona, and #5 Oregon are locked in a battle for a wild-card spot. CA-S looks to be in the driver's seat with their higher tiebreaks, but they'll need to win against #6 Nevada first. Even then, there's still a chance for Arizona or Oregon if one of them can pull off an upset.

Finally, I have one announcement to make: to cover the costs of running this event, I am holding a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/states-chess-cup) campaign to raise $600. If you've been enjoying the States Chess Cup so far, as a player, streamer, or spectator, I would appreciate any amount you can contribute towards the operational costs of the league. Reaching the $600 goal will help ensure that we can continue to organize the league for future seasons.
