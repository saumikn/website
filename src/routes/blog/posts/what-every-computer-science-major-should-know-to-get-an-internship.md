When a new student is starting their journey into the field of computer science, it can be hard to figure out which topics to learn first. In this post, I will give my opinionated review on what every computer science student should know for their first internship. This advice is intended to help you focus your learning efforts effectively.

## Specific Recommendations:

- Have experience writing code in at least one programming language. Python or Java is a reasonable start.
- Be familiar with object-oriented programming. You should understand concepts like classes, objects, methods, and inheritance, and be comfortable writing programs using the OOP paradigm.
- Know how to debug code. This involves using breakpoints and print statements, reading errors inside stack traces, and knowing how to use Google when things go wrong. Chances are, any error you run into already has 1000+ upvotes on Stack Overflow.

All of this should be covered in your first semester "Intro to Programming" class that you take. Alternatively, there are plenty of online resources available. I'm personally a big fan of [Python for Everybody](http://py4e.com/), and I made my add-on exercise book to this course which you can read about [here](https://saumikn.com/blog/an-interactive-exercise-book-to-learn-python-better/). If you're looking for a more typical college-lecture style course, Harvard's [CS 50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) course is a great option.

If you're already familiar with one language, and you're looking to learn a second language, [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com) is a great way to get quickly acquainted with the syntax of any language. I wouldn't recommend this for your first language, but it's a good resource for picking up additional languages.

If you haven't taken any course on algorithms, I would recommend going through a structured course online, like Berkeley's [CS 61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es) or MIT's [CS 6.006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/).

## Specific Recommendations:

- Go through a structured algorithms and data structures course.
- Work through Leetcode problems.

This probably shouldn't be something you just work on endlessly though; once you reach some threshold, you're probably better off working on personal projects or learning other topics. If you can solve most Medium problems in under 30 minutes, you should be in excellent shape.

Full-stack (web) development is almost surely not going to be covered during your freshman year, and probably not in your sophomore year either. However, the [majority of developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#developer-roles-dev-type-us) in the industry are full-stack developers.

## Specific Recommendations:

- Get a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Put together a basic frontend using a framework of your choice (such as React).
- Put together a basic backend using a framework of your choice (such as Flask).
- Learn SQL, and how to connect a database to a backend.

This might seem like a lot, but there are thankfully many resources available online to learn web development. If you're looking for a more lecture-based environment similar to college, Harvard has a course on [Web Programming](https://www.google.com/search?q=harvard+web+programming).

Again, there are a lot of resources online for learning Data Science. My favorite is [Kaggle Learn](http://kaggle.com/learn). They have courses on a number of different topics, all in notebook form so you can practice writing the code to replicate any analysis.

## Projects

Keep in mind that learning from websites, videos, or even courses can only take you a very limited amount of the way towards proficiency. The only way to become truly skilled at any of these topics is by practicing on your own projects, so I've tried to list learning resources that have interactive components or hands-on exercises.

However, once you have a base level of competency for a given area, I definitely encourage you to go start working on projects on your own! Make a website and host it on GitHub or Heroku. Build an API and make it open to the public. Make a smartphone app (though this probably requires some additional knowledge).

In conclusion, the key to success in securing an internship is to focus on building a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and web development, while also engaging in personal projects that showcase your skills. Good luck!
