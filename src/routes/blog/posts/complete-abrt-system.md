In this post, I will present a vision for a complete aBRT system in Minneapolis – a system where every single local bus route has been replaced with a high-quality aBRT line. I will also estimate the cost of building and operating the system and discuss the system’s benefits. While this post does...

## What is aBRT?

Arterial Bus Rapid Transit, or aBRT, is essentially the upgraded version of local bus transit. aBRT routes contain many of the same elements found in traditional BRT or LRT. Limited stop patterns, signal priority, level boarding, and off-board fare collection result in a [25-30% increase in speed](https://metrocouncil.org/Council-Meetings/Committees/Transportation-Advisory-Board-TAB/TAB-Technical-Advisory-Committee/2018/TAC-Meeting-5-02-18/Update-on-Arterial-Bus-Rapid-Transit.aspx). Bus stations will be upgraded with real-time information, heated shelters, and in some...

In 2016, we built our first aBRT line, the A Line, and the response has been incredibly positive. Christof Spieler, a notable planner who oversaw Houston’s recent transit redesign, calls the A Line “[one of the best](https://www.trainsbusespeople.org/transit-tour-guide-twin-cities)”.

The C Line, our second aBRT line, opened in 2019 and mostly replaced Route 19 in North Minneapolis. In the time since the line opened, we again saw an [immediate 30% ridership jump](https://www.metrotransit.org/five-months-after-opening-metro-c-line-surpasses-1m-rides).

## Designing the System

My main goal for this thought exercise was to upgrade routes inside Minneapolis proper, providing a boundary (however arbitrary) for what I define as urban. Therefore, I mostly just picked segments of routes inside Minneapolis proper to convert to aBRT; most routes don’t extend far outside the city borders.

There were a few routes which I needed to extend farther out from Minneapolis because they have significant service operations there, and I didn’t want to skew my analysis. While picking boundaries for these routes, I simply either used the entire route or extended service outside Minneapolis until frequency dropped off. Also, since I thought it made sense operationally, I combined a few pairs of routes into single lines: 3+C Line, 4P+11, 10+18, and 46+A Line.

Using these guidelines, I constructed the below aBRT system. Routes are color-coded based on if they are ‘downtown’ or ‘crosstown’ routes. For visual context, I’ve included the Green, Blue, and Orange lines, as well as the Minneapolis city boundaries. Click [here](https://drive.google.com/o...) for more details.

## How much will it cost?

![Cost Estimate](/uploads/abrt_cost-1024x710.png)

Overall, I estimate that the new aBRT system would cost about $879 million to build, based on the A and C Lines. Using the low ridership increase estimate of 30%, the system would have a net increase of $88 million in operational costs, again based on the A and C Lines.

These costs may seem large at first, but compare it to other proposed transit projects in the Twin Cities (mostly compiled from [here](https://metrocouncil.org/Transportation/Publications-And-Resources/Finance/Metropolitan-Area-Transit-Finance-Report,-2018.aspx)):

- The Green Line LRT Extension will cost $2 billion dollars, with annual operating costs of $39 million. Average daily weekday ridership is projected at 29,000.
- The Blue Line LRT Extension will cost $1.5 billion with $34 million in annual operating costs; ridership is projected at 27,000.

For example, in the [West Broadway corridor](https://metrocouncil.org/Council-Meetings/Committees/Transportation-Committee/2017/February-27,-2017/Info-1_WestBroadway.aspx), the policy committee had two options: a 5-mile, $256 million streetcar, or a 7-mile, $40 million aBRT.

## Fulfilling the Minneapolis Transportation Action Plan

![Transportation Action Plan](/uploads/minneapolis_tap-797x1024-1.png)

Minneapolis recently released its [Transportation Action Plan draft](http://go.minneapolismn.gov/). I actually started writing this post before this draft was released, but the vision expressed in the plan is highly aligned with the goal of a complete aBRT network. Some highlights include:

- 75% of city residents located within a quarter mile and 90% of residents located within a half mile walk of high-frequency transit corridors (**In my example system, these percentages are ~95% and 100%, respectively.**)
- Increase the high-frequency network from 15 to 10 minutes or better (**aBRT does this**)

Instead, what I want readers to understand is that **creating a dramatically improved transit network is not an impossible task. With a relatively small budget and a bit of political will, we could realistically upgrade our entire transportation network.** Making aBRT the standard level of service for all of our local bus routes is one example of a solution that would allow us to fund a world-class transportation system with fast, frequent, and reliable transit service for all.
