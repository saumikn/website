I have a lot of experience watching bad presentations, starting right from elementary school, and going all the way through undergrad, in industry, and in my PhD. This is almost certainly true of everybody reading this right now as well, and you might have some specific experiences that come to mind. In addition, I've also watched a lot of videos and guides on how to give better talks. Finally, there's no replacement for personal experience, and I've learned a ton just by actually giving talks to audiences of various sizes and backgrounds.

This blog post is a summary of all the things I've learned about how to give research presentations and academic talks, and I really hope that this is useful to helping others give better talks. Without further ado, here are the 8 tips I think will help you give better research presentations:

### 1. Start off really, really well

The first 60 seconds of your presentation are by far the most important. These are the precious seconds where your audience will be looking up at you and giving your presentation a chance. You must start off by immediately grabbing their attention, to convince them that the rest of your talk is worth listening to.

There are many ways to hook the audience. You can talk about a specific problem that they have in real life. You can tell a joke (about something related to your work). You can tell them a story about something that has happened to you. At AIES last week, I asked my audience the following question: "How many of you have ever been in a situation where you had to make a tough decision?" This immediately engaged them and set the stage for my talk.

No matter what approach you pick, you should focus on standing out from the crowd. If they get nothing else out of your presentation, **your goal should be for everybody in the audience to remember your name, remember your face**, and come see you at the poster session or a break later.

### 2. Get excited!

When I'm watching a presentation, the worst thing ever is when the speaker is visibly bored while giving the talk. They might not actually even be feeling bored internally, they could be nervous or excited or whatever, but when somebody stands at the podium, stares down at their laptop, and mumbles every word in a monotone, boredom is the only feeling they give off. And when the speaker is bored, this implicitly gives permission to the audience to get bored and disengage as well.

On the other hand, when a speaker is clearly enthusiastic or passionate about a topic, the audience immediately gets drawn in as well. **The number one thing you can do to improve your talk is to get excited!** Look at the audience, smile, laugh, walk around the stage, and engage with them.

In addition to being visually excited, it's important that your voice shows the same thing. Make sure that you're speaking confidently, loudly, and with varying tones and speeds. I understand this might be much harder for a non-native language speaker, but this just means you need to rehearse more.

### 3. Respect your audience

This isn't really a specific tip to follow, but rather a mindset that I think too many speakers don't have when preparing a talk, and it makes us all worse off in the end.

If you're giving a 30-minute talk to a particular audience of 100 people, this means that your audience is collectively investing 50 hours of their own valuable time into hearing what you have to say. You need to properly thank your audience for this, not by a half-hearted thanks slide at the end, but by genuinely respecting their time and attention throughout your talk.

### 4. Make better slides

From my DSS notes on presentation feedback and elsewhere, here are some common tips on how to make better slides:

- Your text should be in a very large font and easily legible from the back of the room.
- Use only a few bullet points of text per slide at most, no long explanations.
- Use animations so your key points don't show up all at once and overwhelm the audience.
- If you're introducing a new term, define it simply. Know that your audience will forget its definition 2 minutes later, and redefine it multiple times through the talk.
- Avoid acronyms as much as possible. You may have one or two acronyms which are critical to your paper, but don't add any more, and use them sparingly.
- Don't just directly copy algorithms, graphs, tables, or equations from the paper. If your graph works equally well in a paper format and presentation format, it's very likely doing a bad job at both.
- Tables of numeric results should almost never be used on slides; it's far better to convert it into a visual plot.
- Don't use mathematical notation or formalism. You should instead define your new math concepts using words.

### 5. Explain your bad slides very well

Occasionally, you will be forced to present a bad slide. You should fight against this as much as possible. Really consider if it's absolutely critical to the success of your talk that you display that complicated algorithm or explain your most complex plot of results. If it isn't, you should aim to build your presentation in such a way that the progression of results seems natural and intuitive from one slide to the next.

### 6. Don't present your paper, advertise it

When thinking about presenting bad or complex slides, one thing to keep in mind when you're making your slides is that **the goal of your research talk is not to present your paper!** If your audience really wanted to understand everything you did, they would just read your paper.

Instead, your job is to convince the audience that your research is worthwhile and interesting, and hopefully at least a handful of people will follow you on Twitter, come to your poster, or read your paper.

### 7. Give your presentation to a middle schooler

A piece of presentation feedback that I often hear at WashU but absolutely hate is that "This would be a good talk at a conference, but not for a general audience." This is usually just code for "Your talk was terrible for a general audience and slightly less terrible for a conference audience."

A good rule of thumb is that even a middle school student should be able to understand everything in your introduction and motivation, and an undergrad in your field should be able to follow your entire presentation. If they get lost in the first few minutes, it's likely that your more specialized audience will too.

### 8. Be clear on your contributions

Throughout the talk, you should be clear on what you've actually done. If you're going over related or prior work, you should explicitly say this, perhaps by providing a reference to some of the claims you make. There should also be a point in your talk where you explicitly transition to new contributions of your work. Use first person as much as you can, saying things like "I did..." or "We analyzed...".

Once you've finished your talk, if your audience doesn't know what they should have learned from your talk, you've given a bad talk! You should have a summary or takeaway slide which explicitly lays out the 3-4 points that they should understand from your work.
