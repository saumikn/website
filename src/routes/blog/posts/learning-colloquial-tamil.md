In this post, I will share my experiences and resources in learning colloquial Tamil, focusing on the updates and additional materials I've discovered along the way.

**Update - July 20, 2023**

I've written two more blog posts on the topic of Colloquial Tamil. The [first](https://saumikn.com/blog/learning-colloquial-tamil-2/) is an update to this post with a few additional learning resources I've found as well as published Anki decks.

The second resource I found is the book _Colloquial Tamil_, which is available online at [archive.org](https://ia800209.us.archive.org/21/items/ColloquialTamil_201512/Colloquial%20Tamil.pdf). This book was published in 2003, so it's pretty old, but it provides a structured approach to learning the language.

The main reason I prefer _Colloquial Tamil_ is that it goes through the material in a better order and is more useful for learners, since the book contains exercises, practice dialogues, and an explanation of grammar that is more suitable for beginners.

However, one significant change is that _Colloquial Tamil_ uses a romanized transliteration of Tamil instead of the natural Tamil script. I've taught myself to read the Tamil script, but I must admit that the transliteration is still easier and faster for me to read. The book does attempt to teach the script along the way, but it can be completely ignored. The transliteration marks retroflex consonants using ʈ/ɖ/ɳ/ɭ, while not distinguishing between the various characters for "n," which aren't distinguishable in modern spoken Tamil.

Over the last week, I read through the entire book and took notes on the grammatical concepts that the book introduces. I have very little knowledge of spoken Tamil grammar, so it was very fun to go through the book and learn about just how different Tamil and English grammar is (so many suffixes!). I've made all of my notes available [here](https://www.notion.so/Colloquial-Tamil-Grammar-e751502877604c508f9168ec04bfd4cc). I also created a table of verb forms that the book mentions [here](https://www.notion.so/Tamil-Verbs-8b8f12d990c24c25b6126d5b243d364).

As a side note, I've set up hotkeys to map "t-x" to "ʈ" (same for the other retroflex consonants) using [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/), and I'd definitely recommend this approach to others. Back in high school when I was learning Esperanto, I used a different method to make typing easier, and I think this is a similar approach that can help with Tamil.

If you're interested in learning colloquial Tamil, I highly recommend checking out the resources mentioned above. They have been incredibly helpful in my journey, and I hope they can assist you as well!
