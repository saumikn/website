# Introduction

Light rail (or LRT) is a type of transit which uses street-running, at-grade trains to transport passengers. It's been seeing a growing surge of interest in American cities over the last few decades, and politicians across the country are proposing light rail as a solution to their cities' transit challenges. The reason is that light rail is seen as a technology which can improve a city's transportation network at a fraction of the cost of heavy rail (i.e. subways or elevated rail).

However, I strongly feel that we should not be pursuing the construction of new light rail (and the related mode of streetcars) systems in America. The simple reason for this is cost - new light rail lines cost anywhere between $100 million to $200 million per mile to construct. As an example, the proposed 5.6 mile [St. Louis Green Line](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(St._Louis_MetroLink)>) is projected to cost $1.1 billion.

This high price tag isn't inherently a bad thing. There have been many expensive projects over history which were well worth the cost. The problem with light rail specifically is that we get almost no value back from its construction. For transit riders, there are almost no benefits to a light rail line over a simple bus line, and in a lot of respects, light rail is even worse for riders. And for cities as a whole, light rail does lead to some improvements and increased development, but at a scale which is very out of line with its high cost.

Instead of light rail or streetcars, I propose that transit agencies invest heavily in a different mode of transit - "Light BRT". If you haven't heard of this term before, it's because I invented it for the purposes of this article, as there is no single widespread term which characterizes this mode. I'm personally hoping that the phrase Light BRT catches on, as it's a very convenient nomenclature to describe these existing transit lines and in a way which is easily distinguishable from the more traditional _Gold-Standard_ or _Heavy_ BRT.

So what is Light BRT? Essentially, Light BRT is a type of city bus which includes many infrastructure upgrades to increase the speed and reliability of the bus line. While not every light BRT line has all of these features, in general, light BRT lines are characterized by the following:

- **Wider stop spacing:** Light BRT buses have stops every 1/4 to 1/2 miles, rather than the 1/8 to 1/4 mile stop spacing of regular city buses. This reduces the amount of time the bus spends at stops.
- **High frequency:** Light BRT lines come frequently, ideally at least every 10 minutes. This reduces passenger waiting time.
- **Signal priority:** Light BRT buses have technology which integrates with city traffic lights. This reduces the amount of time the bus is waiting at a red light.
- **Off-board fare collection:** Instead of the bus operator collecting fares for each passenger, passengers pay at the station itself, and fares are validated using a proof-of-payment system. This reduces the amount of time the bus spends at stops.
- **Bus lanes:** Light BRT may operate either entirely or partially in dedicated transit lanes. This increases bus travel speeds while in motion.
- **Larger buses:** Light BRT takes advantage of larger articulated buses with many doors. This increases the capacity of the system and reduces the amount of time the bus spends at stops.

Each of these improvements leads to a much nicer transit experience for passengers, directly leading to faster trips and higher ridership. For example, in Minneapolis, the D Line launched in late 2022, where they implemented most of the above features on the existing #5 local bus. The D Line was a huge success, well beyond anyone's expectations. In the first _month_ alone, ridership on the D Line [increased 50%](https://www.metrotransit.org/corridor-ridership-up-after-d-line-opening) when compared with the previous city bus. And by the end of the first year, ridership had [nearly doubled](https://metrocouncil.org/News-Events/Transportation/Newsletters/Annual-transit-ridership-2023.aspx#:~:text=The%20D%20Line%27s%20average%20weekday,of%20all%20rides%20in%202023.)! As of early 2024, the D Line has a ridership of over 13,000 daily riders, a number which is actually higher than many light rail systems, and this number is projected to hit 23,000 riders by 2030.

And the best part? This line was incredibly cheap. The 18 mile D Line cost about $75 million in total to construct, for an average cost of about $4 million per mile. Compared to light rail, which can cost $200 million per mile, light BRT is a steal. Or in other words, for the same cost it would take to build a 5 mile LRT line, we could build over 200 miles of light BRT, leading to a much better transit network for an entire city.

As a side note, I want to contrast Light BRT with the more traditional form of BRT (which I'll denote as "Heavy BRT") which features very prominently in the transit systems of many international cities like Istanbul, Jakarta, and Bogota. Heavy BRT is also growing in popularity in the US in cities like Albuquerque, Richmond, and Cleveland. It is characterized by a dedicated concrete guideway which separates the bus from car traffic, and often features center running operations. There is a wide range of intensity of BRT operations (hence the need for the [BRT Standard rubric](https://itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/)). But in general, heavy BRT can cost anywhere between $8 million to $50 million per mile to construct, with the lower end of this spectrum mostly resembling light BRT.

In the rest of this post, I hope to make a convincing argument on why we should stop building new light rail and streetcar lines, and instead transition to prioritizing light BRT. First, I will give a brief overview on the various forms of transit so that we have a common set of definitions to work off of. Next, I will provide an objective set of differences between light rail and light BRT, going over the benefits and drawbacks of each mode for both transit riders and non-riders. Finally, I will give my personal opinions on each of these differences, and why I believe that we should not pursue light rail in America.

In many of the examples and discussions, I will specifically reference the example of the proposed St. Louis Green Line LRT, since it's one I'm more familiar with and I think it's an example of an egregiously bad light rail line. But my comments are generally applicable to any new light rail or streetcar line in the US.

# Overview of Transit Modes

In this section, I'll give a brief overview of the various types of transit modes which are built with rail and buses.

## Types of Rail

![Types of Rail](/uploads/image-1717712968930.png)

- **Heavy Rail:** This is the highest capacity and most expensive transit mode, consisting of long train sets operating in an entirely grade-separated right-of-way. Examples include the New York Subway or the Chicago L.
- **Light Rail:** This is a lower capacity mode and less expensive than heavy rail. LRT systems are mostly not grade-separated, but run alongside street corridors, usually operating in a dedicated lane outside mixed traffic. Examples of light rail are the Minneapolis Light Rail or the San Diego Trolley.
- **Heavy+Light Rail:** As a side note, there are many LRT systems which are very close to heavy rail but are still considered light rail. In these systems, where the vast majority of the system is grade-separated and operates like heavy rail, but there are still a few at-grade crossings. Examples of this are the Seattle Link or the St. Louis MetroLink.
- **Streetcars:** In America, the distinction between LRT and streetcars is very fuzzy, but in general, streetcars usually refer to at-grade trains which run in mixed traffic, and are essentially treated like a city bus on rails instead of tires. Examples of streetcars include the Portland Streetcar or the Kansas City Streetcar.

## Types of Buses

![Types of Buses](/uploads/image-1717713225387.png)

- **"Heavy" BRT:** Heavy BRT aims to replicate heavy or light rail with buses as much as possible, with dedicated concrete guideways separated from mixed traffic and rail-like stations. Examples of heavy BRT include the Albuquerque ART or the Cleveland HealthLine.
- **"Light" BRT:** Light BRT can be thought of as an upgraded city bus, with features like transit signal priority, optimized stop spacing, and off-board fare collection. Examples of light BRT include the Minneapolis aBRT, the New York SBS, or the Seattle RapidRide.
- **City Buses:** This is the standard mode bus which operates in every major city, operating in mixed traffic without any extra features to improve transit operations. It's possible for buses to use special propulsion technology like electric engines with batteries, or elevated wires (i.e. trolleybuses).

# Light Rail vs Light BRT

Next, I will go over the differences between light rail and light BRT. Because there are a lot of differences, I'm going to organize my thoughts into two sections. First, I will discuss the difference between modes in terms of the experiences that actual riders on the system will encounter. Second, I will discuss the difference between modes for everybody else - how it affects non-riders, government officials, citizens, etc. In both of these sections, I'll describe what makes LRT better than light BRT, and vice versa, and I will do my best to make these sections as objective as possible.

## Differences for Transit Riders

### How Light Rail is better than Light BRT

- **Overall Capacity:** This is the biggest, most-cited reason why light rail is better than light BRT. Most common LRT vehicles have a carrying capacity of 200 to 300 passengers per car and can be connected in sets of two or three cars. Assuming a maximum of 2 minutes per stop, this can lead to a significant increase in capacity during peak hours.

### How Light Rail is equal to Light BRT

- **Speed:** Overall, the speed of buses and trains on city streets are approximately the same. I've seen some claims that buses are slightly faster at accelerating/decelerating, but most of the speed differences are due to the infrastructure supporting the transit mode.

## Differences for non-Transit Riders

### How Light Rail is better than Light BRT

- **Energy Efficiency:** Trains are more energy efficient than buses, because of the gains of efficiency by using rails. This difference is reduced to some degree if you consider the energy usage of a three-car light rail vs a single bus, but overall, trains are more efficient.

### How Light Rail is worse than Light BRT

- **Construction Cost:** This is the biggest reason that Light BRT is better than Light Rail. In America, Light Rail tends to cost $100M-200M per mile to construct (e.g. the proposed St. Louis Green Line will cost $196M per mile for the 5.6 mile route). On the other hand, Light BRT can be constructed for a fraction of that cost.

# Conclusion

In my opinion, when you consider all of the differences, there is really no reason why we should be building Light Rail or Streetcars anywhere in America. For transit riders, light BRT provides an arguably more useful service than LRT, at a fraction of the cost. For non transit-riders, LRT can be a burden on city budgets and resources.

I'm sure this post has some very controversial opinions. If you disagree with me, and think I'm missing some broader point about LRT, feel free to let me know in the comments. I'm especially interested in actual case studies where the capacity of LRT was necessary over light BRT, or where LRT demonstrably led to increased development.
