Tomorrow is my first day at Washington University in St. Louis, where I will be working towards a PhD in Computer Science! While I spend the next 4-6 years of my life here, I've decided to make a commitment: I will write at least one blog post every week until I finish my PhD.

There are a few main reasons why I want to do this blog. The first reason is I want to get better at writing. One of the most important parts of a PhD is writing, and there is a lot to write :). Throughout the PhD, I need to be publishing papers at top-tier conferences and journals. At the same time, I want to document my journey and share my experiences with others.

The second reason I want to write a blog is to keep myself honest about my progress in school. I imagine that most of my posts will be related to something that I've done that week, which will let me self-evaluate on a regular interval. If I'm not progressing as fast as I would like, I can reflect on what I need to change.

The last reason I'm writing this blog is when I finally finish my PhD, I'll be able to look back on everything and appreciate how much I've actually done and how much I've improved. I'm fully expecting that several years in the future, a lot of these posts will look cringy or really badly written or whatever, but that's all part of the process :).

So, what exactly will I be writing about? In general, I'll try to write about topics related to what I've done or learned that week. However, if I don't have something specific from that week, I might just write about any random topic that I'm interested in. I've got a backlog of topics I want to write about, so I'm not too worried about a lack of things to write about :). I'll try to commit to writing at least 200 words a week, which seems pretty doable as a minimum cutoff.

This is all I have for now, see everybody next week when school starts!
